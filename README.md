# Indian Sign Language Image Classification

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a rich and diverse language used by the Deaf community in India for communication. This project is dedicated to the classification of ISL signs captured as images, enabling us to bridge the communication gap and make technology more inclusive.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build robust image classification models that can accurately recognize and classify ISL signs from images. By harnessing the power of computer vision and machine learning, we contribute to enhancing communication and accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community in India.

## Dataset

Our project relies on a comprehensive dataset comprising a wide range of ISL signs captured as images. This dataset serves as the foundation for training, testing, and validating our classification models.
